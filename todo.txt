Add a subtest template for SUBSTRINGS being equal
(i.e. func(123ABC456, ABC) == 1) but DON'T put it in standard template
(for use on algorithms that SHOULD return 1 when one is a subset of the other)

Change benchmark_test
* Instead of running all 100k tests and checking the time, instead check the time every
  loop and fail when time > 1 sec. On failure, report on the number of passes it managed
  to get through.
